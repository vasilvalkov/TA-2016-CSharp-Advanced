Problem 7 – Bad Cat!
--------------------

I had a **number** (with distinct digits) written on a sheet of paper.
My cat (Sid) ate it (she loves to eat paper)!
Now I can only remember that some digits were before or after others. My memory is good and the order of digits I remember are always correct.
Please help me **find the smallest possible number that corresponds to the digits order I remember**.
The number was valid integer number with no leading zeroes.
There is always a possible solution.

### Input

The input data should be read from the console.</br?
On the first line there will be the number **N**.</br>
On each of the next **N** lines there will be a string in the format “***X is before Y***” or “***X is after Y***”. **X** and **Y** will be valid digits (‘0’ – ‘9’).</br>
The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.

### Output

The output data should be printed on the console.</br>
On the only output line write the smallest possible number that corresponds to the rules described in the input.

### Constraints

-   **N** will be between 1 and 20.
-   Allowed working time for your program: 0.05 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.

### Examples

| **Example input** | **Example output** |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| 5</br>1 is before 2</br>4 is after 2</br>3 is before 4</br>6 is after 4</br>6 is before 8      | 123468             |
| 6</br>8 is before 7</br>6 is before 5</br>3 is after 4</br>1 is after 2</br>2 is before 1</br>1 is after 2       | 21436587           |
